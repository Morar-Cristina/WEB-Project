For my Web Development Class, I have created a website (in VS Code), by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, deploying this using XAMPP, for a fictive pet shelter. The user is able to:
  -Create an account
  -Log in
  -Browse through the pets up for adoption
  -Send any questions they have using a form in the Contact Page
